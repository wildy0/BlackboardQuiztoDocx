# BlackboardQuiztoDocx
This project can read Quiz/assessment zip files from Blackboard LMS exports.  The zip file is processed and the quiz questions are output to a word docx file.  The word files will contain Questions (essay questions) and answers (if given in the quiz setup).  MCQs have correct answer highlighted and a separate output LAMs TBL word import format.
